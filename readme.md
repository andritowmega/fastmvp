# Fast MVP
It is a project that I started in express javascript. Given the large number of entrepreneurship projects for startups to develop. This project is dedicated to entrepreneurial programmers, it does not focus on quality and correct architecture, we will bet everything on speed in developing mvp's to validate ideas.
# Why use it
* You need to develop a quick mvp
* Install it in less than a minute
* Focus on the FrontEnd
* Validate your Idea

# Until when to use it?
* If your startup starts generating income then change this by developing your robust custom backend
